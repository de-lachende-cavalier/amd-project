# Running the code

The first time you're running the code I suggest setting the `first_run` variable at the start of the notebook to `True`, to go through it all bit more quickly (it should take more or less 25 minutes).
To go through all the code in its entirety, simply set the variable to `False` and then Run All (this could take a whole day, if not more, because of the RNN code).

I don't suggest going the latter route though.
Rather, after the first run, I'd suggest setting the `first_run` variable to `False`, then expanding the parts of the notebooks that you might find interesting and running them independentely from the rest of the notebook, thus focusing on single parts and not on the whole.
Additionally, to make this way of running the code more user-friendly, I have repeated (hopefully) all the necessary code for data preparation at the beginning of the various sections, that way the sections could **almost** be considered as independent.
