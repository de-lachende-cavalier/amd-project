## Running the code

The first time running the code I suggest setting the `first_run` variable at the start of the notebook to `True`, to go through it a bit quicker (it should take more or less 25 minutes).
To go through all the code, simply set the variable to `False` (this could take even a whole day, because of the RNN code).

I don't suggest going the latter route though: rather, after the first run I'd suggest setting the variable to `False`, then expanding the parts of the notebooks that you might find interesting and running them independentely from the rest of the notebook
